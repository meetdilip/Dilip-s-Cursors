# Dilip's Cursors
Windows Cursor Theme Built Using GIMP

This is a simple Windows Cursor theme built using GIMP 2.99.16 released yesterday. 

I wanted to try GIMP for building Windows Cursor themes and this theme is a result of that. 

Built 100% using GIMP 2.99.16. All .cur and .ani files were drawn and exported using my Wacom tablet + mouse inside GIMP.

I prepared the pack in less than 4 hours. It is more of a demo of GIMP's abilities than a very beautiful cursor theme.
